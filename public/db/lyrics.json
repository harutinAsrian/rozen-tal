    I have to find something i’ve felt before
    It’s all about the roundabout
    It’s the only thing I can’t live without
    
    I see the guard, i’ve found the road
    Let me pass or just cut my throat
    I see a figure in the duck walk pose
    Passing by I get my lethal dose
    
    What a thrill, what a kill
    What an exceptionally spectacular skill
    The price I paid, thrice re-paid
    Really is worth being here
    
    Until I’m crazy, hazy, lazy
    The step inside made me free
    I’m crazy, hazy, lazy
    Doing the snake dance in the sea
    
    Now i’m off to the Erie shore
    I’m up to find something never felt before
    It’s still about the roundabout
    It is mental addiction in and out
    
    I’ve seen the lights, the human seas
    My name burnt on the highlight screens
    So tell me please until I sneeze
    Will I go far with this breeze?,
